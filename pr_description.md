## Problem
The agent has been experiencing several critical issues:
1. Empty responses after tool executions (particularly with web searches)
2. Getting stuck in loops without generating meaningful content 
3. Ambiguous query handling leading to repetitive questions
4. Lack of testing infrastructure 

## Solution
This PR implements comprehensive agent improvements:

### 1. Generic Tool Response Synthesis
- Added mechanism to handle empty responses after ANY tool execution
- Dynamically identifies which specific tools were used in conversation history
- Creates custom synthesis prompts based on the tools used
- Counts tool executions as valid steps even with empty responses

### 2. Ambiguous Query Handling
- Enhanced ability to handle unclear user requests
- Improved prompt templates for better guidance
- Better parameter handling in stuck state detection

### 3. Web Search Improvements
- Fixed issues with empty responses after web searches
- Enhanced result processing for better information synthesis
- Increased token limit (4096 â†’ 8192) to handle large search results

### 4. Testing & Input Infrastructure
- Added pytest configuration and test directory structure
- Created unit tests for agent functionality
- Added dedicated input handler for more consistent user interaction

## Real-World Examples from Testing

### Example 1: Stuck State Detection and Resolution
**Before:**
```
Agent selected 0 tools to use
Agent deeply stuck in a loop and cannot proceed
```
The agent got stuck in a repetitive question loop. After user intervention, it attempted to use a tool but failed with timeout, then immediately returned to being stuck with the same question.

### Example 2: Empty Tool Responses Not Synthesized
**Before:**
```
Activating tool: web_search
Tool web_search completed its mission! Result: [list of URLs]
Manus's thoughts: [empty]
```
The agent successfully executed web searches but had empty thoughts and didn't synthesize anything useful from the search results, continuing for many steps without progress.

### Example 3: Ambiguous Query Handling
**Before:** The agent repeatedly asked the same clarification question without adapting to user responses:
```
I can help with that! To get started, could you tell me what specific aspects of AI-enabled SaaS ideas you're interested in?
```
Even after receiving responses like 'machine learning aspect', it would loop back to the same question.

## Testing
These changes were thoroughly tested with several scenarios:
1. Web search followed by meaningful synthesis
2. Handling ambiguous queries with appropriate follow-up
3. Proper parameter handling during stuck states
4. Unit tests for all core agent functionalities

The improvements ensure the agent can now effectively:
- Process tool results (especially web searches) and generate insights
- Avoid repetitive question loops
- Recover gracefully from tool execution failures
- Provide better guidance when clarification is needed
